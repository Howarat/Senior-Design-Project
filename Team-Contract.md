We may occasionally meet up in person or have online video calls to discuss the design and progress of the project.

### Project Focus:
The focus of this project is to create a web application that is capable of displaying combined blockchain mining pool statistics to anyone interested in the data, whether a cryptominer or a data analyst. This will focus on the creation of a web server to handle the backend of the web app, as well as a polished front end to view and download reports from. Major topics explored will include web app development, blockchain technology, and cryptomining.
