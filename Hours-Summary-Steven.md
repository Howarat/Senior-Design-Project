I personally spent around 400 hours on this project including both semesters, with that amount being almost split evenly between both semesters. 
I spent around 150 in fall and 250 in the Spring. In the Fall Semester, I focused most of my time on learning more about the backend technologies 
that went into this project. I had to learn about NodeJS, MongoDB, and the Ethermine and Nanopool APIs from scratch as I had not ever worked with these 
technologies before. I learned these technologies mostly from youtube video tutorial and udemy courses.    
In the Spring Semester, it was mostly focused on actual development work on the webapp and setting up the 
backend of the project. Aside from actual development work, I also put in work to research ways to improve upon our 
product as well as ways that we would be able to include more polling data so that we could store long term data for analysis.
