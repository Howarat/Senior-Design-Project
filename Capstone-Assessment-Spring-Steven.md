I believe that my individual contribution to the project is mainly in development of the backend as well as the overall administrative work for the project. For the administrative side of things, I scheduled meetings that would work for both of us and created documents that we would need such as the poster and the power point.    
    
I believe that I was able to apply and build upon the skills that I planned to work on, which was my backend development as well as learning new technologies such as RaspberryPi, MongoDB, and general API usage through NodeJS. I was able to go through this by learning all of these skills through my work on the backend as well as tutorials and learning online. For successes, I believe that it was the implementation of the backend that allowed for the web app to function. I believe it was a success because it not only worked, but it also was something that I had not really worked on before. For obstacles, the main obstacle was the learning process since I had not ever used any of these technologies before at all.
