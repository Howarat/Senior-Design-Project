### Project Topic Area:
* Blockchain Mining Pool Data Analysis Web Application

### Project Abstract & Problem Statement:
* Crpytominers frequently use different mining pools to maintian the highest profitiability and compatibility amongst graphics cards. Blockchain analysis experts also compare the data amongst multiple mining pools when creating reports. With Combined Mining, a web app will be made that allows users to track their statistics and store them for historical analysis for data across several pools. No longer will miners be forced to spend hours maintaining ever changing spreadsheets of data, the data will be readily available for them to monitor their investment. The web application will provide an overview of users mining pools that they connect to their accounts.

### Inadequacy of Current Solutions to Problem:
* Currently there is no "one" app to check for an overview of mining stats across multiple mining pools.
* Certain mining pools have been known to be "sketchy" or charge exorbinant fees, this web app would allow those profit guages to be more easily noticed .

### Background Skills/Interests Applicable to Problem:
* Austin and Steven both have previous experience mining crypto and are interested in learning more about blockchain technology and how to interact with its API endpoints.
* Austin & Steven both have web app development experience from their time on coop and learning at UC.

### Project Teams Approach to Problem:
* To start, data will need to be collected from mining pools through their APIs. This data will need to be stored for analysis (short & long term), meaning a database will need to be constructed. We will need to identify all important information that crypto miners/blockchain analyst will need to construct this database. Once a prototype of the backend is created, we will construct reports from this data. The database will also need to be updated periodically to provide the most accurate and reliable data, so automated backend scripts will need to be made to ensure this. The result will be a web application which miners or data analyst can use to view short and long terms trends related to their data. This will include things such as profitability, block difficulty, hash rate, and comparisons between mining pools. Additionally features such as control of miners could be implemented.
